I developed a dynamic web-based resume application with the aim of presenting my skills, experiences, and projects in a user-friendly format. The application featured a modern and intuitive user interface crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensureseamless navigation. It provided comprehensive resume information including education, work experience, achievements,introduction, and project details, all organized in a clear and structured layout. Additionally, users could enter their details into theapplication, and upon reviewing, they could download their resume as a PDF. To enhance user experience, dynamic content updatesbased on user interactions were implemented. The outcome of this project was the development of a professional portfoliodemonstrating proficiency in web development and frontend programming, thereby preparing me for future software developmentopportunities.
